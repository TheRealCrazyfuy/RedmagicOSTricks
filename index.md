# REDMAGIC Docs

{: .warning }
This documentation is unfinished, while I try to do my best there's still many missing parts, we're open for contributions if anyone wants to help improving this documentation.

Welcome to this unofficial documentation for REDMAGIC OS devices!

This site serves as a comprehensive resource for users looking to get the most out of their REDMAGIC OS-powered devices. While still a work in progress, we're constantly expanding and improving our content.

Your contributions are invaluable—if you’d like to help enhance these docs, feel free to submit a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheRealCrazyfuy/RedmagicOSTricks). Together, we can build a better resource for the community!

If you're on desktop you can find all information on the left sidebar while if you're on mobile you can press on the 3 lines at the top right of your screen.
