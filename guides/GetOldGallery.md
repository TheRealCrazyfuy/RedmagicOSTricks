You will need:
- REDMAGIC phone

### 1. Download the apk
You can download the old Gallery apk from [here](https://github.com/TheRealCrazyfuy/RedmagicOSTricks/raw/main/oldgallery.apk)

### 2. Install the apk
- Open the Files app and go to downloads
- Find the oldgallery.apk file and press on it
  
  - If it's the first time you manually install an apk you might see a security message blocking it, don't worry, just press on the `settings` option and allow the permission
- Once the app is installed you can open it, it will ask for images and files permissions, you need to allow everything for proper functionality.

## Known issues
- If the images aren't showing you need to long press on the app icon and select `app info`, then go to `permissions` and allow everything there
- Some REDMAGIC 9 pro users reported the Gallery app not working properly, we tried it on a REDMAGIC 9 pro and it's working for us, needs more investigation.
